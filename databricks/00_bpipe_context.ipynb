    "Bloomberg B-Pipe (Bloomberg Data License - Real-Time Feed) is an enterprise-grade data feed that provides real-time market data, such as live quotes, trades, order book updates, and reference information, directly into firms’ internal systems. Unlike Bloomberg Terminal (for humans), B-Pipe powers automated trading platforms, risk engines, portfolio systems, and analytics applications. It is designed for low-latency, high-reliability, institutional use.\n",
    "Data from B-Pipe often must be published into a firm’s internal message bus (e.g. Kafka) to decouple raw Bloomberg sessions from consuming applications, adding operational overhead, increasing latency and requiring complex mapping and transformation.\n",
    "We introduce a lightweight, open-source connector that allows Databricks customers to directly stream B-Pipe data into Spark (and Spark Streaming) pipelines without relying on intermediate enterprise buses or heavy middleware, simplifying architecture and enabling real-time analytics whilst ensuring built-in support for bloomberg entitlements and audit trails through unity catalog.\n",
